# openlayer-map

## Description

This webpage application uses the [OpenLayers] (https://openlayers.org/) to search for places.

## Process 
1. Set up a new openlayer map project.
* The development setup uses [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) (14 or higher) and requires that you have git installed.
* run 'npm create ol-app' command in Terminal to create a basic app with index.html, main.js, and style.css files.
* cd to the working directory of the app, and then run 'npm start'. Open http://localhost:5173/ to see the new application

2. Work on the html, css and js files for styles and functionalities
* Place search functionality
* Animation effect of map changes


3. Deployment of the app
* After the changes are done, run 'npm run build'. This will create a dist directory with a new index.html and assets that make up the app. 
* Deploy the page drom the 'dist' folder. Find more about []'Deploying a subfolder to GitHub Pages'] (https://gist.github.com/joshuapekera/ef364073b01fb0e21d3f)
